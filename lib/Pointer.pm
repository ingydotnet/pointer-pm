=head1 NAME

Pointer - Object Oriented Memory Pointers in Pure Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Pointer;
 use Pointer::int;
 use Pointer::sv;

 # Hello, world the hard way
 print pointer->of_scalar("Hello, world")->get_pointer->get_pointer->get_string;

 # Test to see if a scalar is a string
 print "It's a string!"
   if pointer('sv')->of_scalar('12345')->sv_flags & SVf_POK;

 # Hex dump of the first 3 words of the SV for $/
 print "> $_\n" for pointer('int')->of_scalar($/)->get_hex(3);

 # Print 5 integers 10 integers away from the address of $$
 print((pointer('int')->of_scalar($$) + 10)->get(5));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to create Perl objects that emulate C pointers.
You can use them to read and explore the memory of your Perl process.

Pointer.pm (and every subclass) exports a function called C<pointer>
that returns a new pointer object. Each object has a type like (void,
int, long, sv). Support for each pointer type is written as a subclass
of Pointer.pm. Pointer.pm itself is for type C<void>. To create a
pointer to a long integer, do:

    use Pointer::long;
    my $p = pointer('long');

Your new pointer is not pointing to anything yet. One way to put an
address into the pointer is directly, like this:

    $p->to(0x123456);

Another way is to point it at an existing scalar like this:

    $p->of_scalar($foo);

Both of these methods return the pointer so that you can chain other
methods onto them:

    my $int = $p->of_scalar($foo)->get;

The C<get> method returns whatever the pointer points to. Since C<$p> is
an integer pointer, this call returns an integer. The C<get> method
takes an optional number as an argument, which indicates the number of
values to get.

Pointer pointers honor pointer arithmetic. If you add or subtract a
number to a pointer, the result is another pointer. As in C pointer
arithmetic, the number of bytes added to the address depends on the size
of the type represented by the pointer.

    my $p1 = pointer('long')->of_scalar($foo);
    my $p2 = $p1 - 5;

is the same as:

    my $p1 = pointer('long')->of_scalar($foo);
    my $p2 = pointer('long')->address($p1->address - 5 * $p1->sizeof);

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available for all pointers:

=over 4

=item * to()

Sets the address of a pointer to a specific integer. Returns the pointer
object for chaining calls.

=item * of_scalar()

Sets the address of a pointer to the address a Perl scalar or SV.
Returns the pointer object for chaining calls.

=item * address()

Returns the memory address of the pointer as an integer.

=item * hex_address()

Returns the address as a hexadecimal string.

=item * type()

Returns the type of the pointer.

=item * sizeof()

Returns the size (in bytes) of whatever type of data is pointed to.

=item * get()

Get the item(s) pointed to by the pointer. This function takes a numeric
argument indicating how many items you want to retrieve. The function
returns a list of the items requested.

=item * get_hex()

Similar to C<get>, but returns the items in hexadeciaml.

=item * get_string()

Returns the null terminated string pointed to by the pointer.

=item * get_pointer()

If your pointer points to a pointer address, this call will take the
pointer address, and return a new pointer object that contains it.
You can pass in the type of the new pointer. The default type is a
void pointer.

=item * get_raw()

Returns the raw byte content pointed to by the pointer. You will need to
unpack the raw data yourself. Takes an argument indicating how many
bytes to return.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

Pointer.pm was made to be subclassed. Every type of pointer is a
subclass. See the modules: Pointer::int, Pointer::long and Pointer::sv
for examples.

=head1 BUGS & DEFICIENCIES

Pointers are tricky beasts, and there are myriad platform issues. At
this point, Pointer.pm is but a naive attempt at a novel idea. Hopefully
it can be fleshed out into a robust and serious module.

Support for pointers to structs is minimal, but is a primary design
goal. Pointer ships with a subclass for the sv struct as an example.
Expect better struct support in a future release.

If you have a good feel for C pointers, and grok where I am trying to go
with this module, please send me an email with your good ideas.
